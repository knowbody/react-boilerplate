React Boilerplate
===

I've done it so many times manually that now is the time to just have a repo with the initial setup.

### Setup includes

- React

- Babel 6 (presets: `es2015`, `react`, `stage-0`)

- Webpack

- Eslint

- Hot reloading (HMR)

### Get started

1. Clone and navigate to the repo directory

2. Install dependencies: `npm install`

3. Run project: `npm start`

4. Navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:3000 in your browser

5. (For linting) Run: `npm run lint`

### Contribute

If you spot any bugs or if you thing I should improve something, please file an issue or send a PR with suggested changes.
